The Idea  
In a world where women still feel unsafe walking alone — especially at night — RakshaBandhan AI is here to be that invisible yet powerful *bhai*. It's an AI-powered safety companion app + smart wearable that senses stress, danger, and activates help... **even before you scream.**

### Why this matters:
🚺 Over 80% of women in India report feeling unsafe in public spaces.  
🚨 Current safety apps often rely on manual input & constant network – which isn’t practical in panic or no-signal situations.

---

## 🚀 Features (Planned)  
- **Stress Detection** via voice & walking pattern changes  
- **Automatic Alerts** sent to emergency contacts with live location + audio  
- **Hidden SOS Triggers** in rings, bangles & other smart jewellery  
- **Offline Mode** to record and send data once the signal returns  
- **AI Companion Mode** that talks to you, distracts potential threats & records

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack (To be used)  
- Android App (Java/Kotlin)  
- AI for motion & audio analysis  
- Firebase or custom server for alerts  
- Wearable integration (BLE, sensors)

---

## 👥 Team  
Currently forming an amazing team! ✨  
Looking for:  
- 🧑‍💻 Android App Developer (AI experience is a bonus!)  
- 🎨 UI/UX designer or creative thinker for storytelling & visual design

Impact  
This isn’t just an app — it’s a **movement for real-time, AI-enabled women’s safety**.  
Built for India. Built for inclusion. Built to save lives
